This is an old version of an openFrameworks addon created by Deborah Schmidt as an extension 
to the builtin ofxGui that comes with openFrameworks, very slightly modified by myself.
The current version of ofxGuiextended can be found at github.com/frauzufall/ofxGuiExtended
It's rewritten from the ground up and much better.
I didn't use it because it requires ofJSON, which is not in the stable release of openFrameworks yet.
